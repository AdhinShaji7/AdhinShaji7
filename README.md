I am a frontend developer with a strong foundation in building scalable, high-performance web and mobile applications. My current work focuses on React, where I develop modern user interfaces, architect reusable components, and integrate complex APIs.

I'm also expanding my capabilities in backend development using Flask (Python), and working with Android (Java) to bridge web and mobile technologies. I believe in writing clean, maintainable code and building solutions that are both functional and intuitive.

Current Focus

- Building production-ready frontend interfaces with React
